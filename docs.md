### My notes (Goals ordered by recency (latest stuff at the end))

I'll first try by supporting stdio since it's simple and can test on vim

Things are okay, It would be nice If I model the domain problem to implement the lsp protocol [here](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#serverCapabilities)
case classes are decent for modelling

objects -> jsonstring is hard here for this usecase. I wish I could've used TypeScript but it's not good for jvm language especially since zoomba has a debugger which requires a jar anyway.
